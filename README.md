# Image GrayScale Converter

## Execution Time

- **10x10**: `0.000 ms`
- **100x100**: `0.000 ms`
- **1000x1000**: `1.600 ms`

## Analysis

- **For Small Images (10x10, 100x100)**:
  - The function performs consistently and efficiently with minimal execution time, effectively processing images.

- **For Larger Images (1000x1000)**:
  - As the image size increases, the execution time grows proportionally. This demonstrates that the algorithm scales with the number of input pixels, but remains efficient, processing a `1000x1000` image in just `1.600 ms`.
