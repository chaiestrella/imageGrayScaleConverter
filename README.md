# imageGrayScaleConverter

Execution Time:

[10 * 10]: 0.000ms

[100 * 100]: 0.000ms

[1000 * 1000]: 1.600ms

Analysis:

For images under 100 * 100 pixels, it is consistent and efficient in its conversion for inputs. 

On the otherhand, for larger pixels such as 1000 * 1000, it shows that execution times grows with the num of input size.
